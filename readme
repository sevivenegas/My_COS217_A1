What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I think it was a pretty straight forward assignment especially if you do not do the challenge. 
Using my experience from C in the past I attempted the challenge; however found it difficult as 
I likely overcomplicated the solution (switch back to no challence). Other than that I found this 
assignment to be a good warm up into C.
